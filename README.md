# PokeAPI TypeScript from JSON Schemas

This repository contains a basic generator that converts the JSON schemas found in https://github.com/PokeAPI/api-data/tree/master/data/schema/v2 to TypeScript interfaces. While more updated than the generator made from the docs (see [here](https://github.com/mudkipme/pokeapi-v2-typescript)), it does not provide descriptions to the fields in the interfaces.

# TODO

- [ ] Include the `pokedex-promise-v2` methods in the `types.d.ts`
- [ ] Make the generator pick the schemas from the repository
